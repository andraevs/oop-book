At 18:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on 6 October 2021, the JMA noted that an area of low pressure embedded within a large monsoonal circulation had formed to the north of Palau.[5] The system developed into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC of the next day.[6] At 09:00 UTC (17:00 PHT) on 7 October, PAGASA began issued its first bulletin for the depression, and assigned it the name Maring.[3][7] The JMA also noted the persistence of another, nearby tropical depression to its Northeast, later named Nando.[8] As it is embedded in the same monsoonal depression and due to its proximity, Nando began to merge with Maring, and therefore formed a rather broad and large circulation at a diameter of 1900km, beating Lekima of 2007 by 200km.[9][10] This prompted the JMA to upgrade the overall system to a tropical storm, and was named Kompasu.[11] However at that time, the JTWC still considered the system as two separate disturbances and issued separate TCFAs later in the day for both depressions, albeit noting the possibility of merging.[12][13] The JTWC later considered the entire system as merged with their first warning for Kompasu.[14] At midnight of October 11, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, as it attained good cloud characteristics.[15] At 12:10 UTC (20:10 PHT) on 11 October, Kompasu made landfall on Fuga Island, Cagayan, as a severe tropical storm.[3][16] At 05:00 PHT of 13 October (21:00 UTC of 12 October), the PAGASA issued its final bulletin as its exited the PAR and continued towards Hainan.[17] Between 03:00 and 09:00 UTC of 13 October, Kompasu had made landfall over the east coast of Hainan.[18][19] By 18:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm, as it crossed the entire island and entered the Gulf of Tonkin, as its convection had rapidly weakened because of the rough terrain of the island.[20][21] At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC issued its final warning followed by downgrading to a tropical depression, as its convection had diminished and the low-level circulation center had been weakened significantly because of the increasing vertical wind shear and dry air, despite not making landfall over northern Vietnam.[22] The JMA issued its final warning after downgrading it to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC.[23][24]

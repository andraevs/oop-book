Sir David Anthony Andrew Amess (/ˈeɪmɪs/ AY-miss; 26 March 1952 – 15 October 2021) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West from May 1997 until his killing in 2021. He previously served as MP for Basildon from June 1983 to April 1997. He was a member of the Conservative Party.

Born and raised in Essex, Amess studied economics and government at Bournemouth University and then had short careers as a primary school teacher, underwriter and recruitment consultant. He was elected as a Conservative councillor for Redbridge in 1982 and MP for Basildon in 1983. His position was seen as a bellwether seat, exemplifying the enthusiasm of the "Essex man" for the government of Margaret Thatcher. He held the seat in the election of 1992, but when boundary changes made it untenable, he became MP for Southend West in 1997 until his death, 24 years later.

In government, his highest position was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Portillo for twelve years. He was more prominent as a backbencher, serving on many Select Committees and sponsoring several pieces of legislation, including the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Act (1988) and Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act (2000). The causes for which he campaigned included animal welfare, awarding city status to Southend-on-Sea, the honouring of Raoul Wallenberg and support for those suffering from endometriosis.

A socially-conservative Roman Catholic who opposed abortion and same-sex marriage, his political views included support for the reintroduction of capital punishment and Brexit. He married in 1983, and had five children, including actress Katie Amess.

On 15 October 2021, Amess was stabbed multiple times while holding a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea. He died at the scene.[1] A 25-year-old British citizen, Ali Harbi Ali, who is understood to have extremist Islamist beliefs,[2] was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and later detained under the Terrorism Act. On 21 October, he was charged with murder and preparing terrorist acts.[3][4]
